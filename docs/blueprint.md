## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#29ABE2) to represent technology and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean, documentation-like feel.
- Accent color: Darker blue (#1E86AF) to highlight key elements and interactive components.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to combine a modern look and some warmth for readability.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif with a techy, scientific feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clear, concise icons to represent different categories and types of content. Consistent style to match the technical aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean, documentation-focused layout, similar to the arduino.cc site. Left-side navigation, collapsible for better content focus.
- Subtle animations on page transitions and when interacting with elements (e.g., collapsing navigation) for a smoother user experience.
